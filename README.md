These codes aim to generate theoretical shear velocity and attenuation structures based on thermal model and solidus model

Please see thermalstart.f90, Q_vs_pre_external.f90, which are core codes of the prediction.
In thermalstart.f90, you can edit the solidus model. In Q_vs_pre_external.f90, you can change the corresponding output files.
Please put the chosen thermal model in ./geotherm.
